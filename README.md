The song 'No one' talk about the loss of a loved one. Sometimes life can be hard, or challenging, because we miss each other, because the one we love passed away or disappears from our life. This situation makes us vulnerable because we feel the emptiness left by the absence of the other. Nevertheless, our soul and heart are so powerful that they can find another way to love. I think the strongest feeling we can have is made from this invisible link that exists between us and those we love. In his song, 'One more light', Linkin Park says: "Just coz you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there"

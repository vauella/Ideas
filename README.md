# No One

A musical reflection on loss, absence, and the enduring power of love.

## About This Project

This song explores the emotional journey after losing someone we love, whether through death or separation. It captures the vulnerability of feeling that emptiness while discovering our heart's remarkable ability to find new paths toward love and connection.

## Inspiration

The invisible bonds that connect us to those we love remain one of life's most powerful forces. As Linkin Park reminds us in "One More Light," these connections persist even when they can't be seen.

## Girl

This companion piece examines the aftermath of a romantic relationship between two women, aiming to bridge understanding through music. It serves as a reminder that love transcends boundaries and identities.

Girl, you got my fire, burning from last year You got my rhythm and push it to the sky Till you played up on me, you could see me cry This boy you're hiding, got me broken down Woah, woah, woah, woah Woah, woah, woah, woah

My sorrow's over I give you back your lies Give me back my soul I give you back your lies Give me back my soul My sorrow's over

Girl, the tears I've cried
Won't wash away what we had inside
Two hearts once beating as one
Now shattered like the setting sun

Every memory burns like fire
Your touch, a ghost I still desire
This love between us girls was true
Now I'm learning to live without you

(Chorus)
My sorrow's over
I give you back your lies
Give me back my soul
I give you back your lies
Give me back my soul
My sorrow's over

The world may judge what we had
Called our love wrong, called it bad
But what we shared was pure and real
These wounds, girl, will someday heal

Walking tall through the pain
Like sunshine after the rain
This broken heart will mend in time
Finding strength in this reggae rhyme

(Bridge)
Every woman deserves to love
With no shame from up above
Artists sing to build the bridge
Love is love, that's what we give

(Chorus)
My sorrow's over
I give you back your lies
Give me back my soul
I give you back your lies
Give me back my soul
My sorrow's over


## Girl DeepSeek 
Here’s a rewritten version of your lyrics, keeping the original structure and emotional core while refining the flow and imagery. I’ve preserved your powerful themes of love, heartbreak, and resilience while adding a bit more poetic cohesion:  

---

**Verse 1 (Original, kept intact):**  
*Girl, you got my fire, burning from last year  
You got my rhythm and push it to the sky  
Till you played up on me, you could see me cry  
This boy you're hiding, got me broken down  
Woah, woah, woah, woah  
Woah, woah, woah, woah*  

**Chorus (Original, kept intact):**  
*My sorrow's over  
I give you back your lies  
Give me back my soul  
I give you back your lies  
Give me back my soul  
My sorrow's over*  

**Verse 2 (Rewritten):**  
*Girl, the tears I’ve cried—  
Ain’t enough to drown the light  
Two hearts tangled in the night  
Now just echoes left behind  

Every whisper, every touch  
Fades to smoke, but burns too much  
Love like ours was bold and true  
Now I’m learning life without you*  

**Chorus (Reaffirmed):**  
*My sorrow's over...*  

**Bridge (Rewritten for Empowerment):**  
*Let ‘em talk, let ‘em stare  
Love don’t live by rules or fear  
What we had, no chains could hold  
Even broken, it was gold*  

**Verse 3 (Rewritten for Closure & Growth):**  
*Walking tall through the storm  
Scars remind me I was warm  
Time ain’t kind, but time don’t lie  
One day, I’ll just wave goodbye*  

**Final Chorus (Expanded with Resolve):**  
*My sorrow's over  
I give you back your lies  
Give me back my soul  
I give you back the nights  
Keep the memories cold  
My sorrow's over*  

**Outro (New, for Catharsis):**  
*Girl, the fire’s fading slow  
But the embers still glow  
One love, two souls undone  
Now my freedom’s the sun*

### Key Improvements:  
1. **Sharper Imagery** – "Echoes left behind," "fades to smoke," and "embers still glow" deepen the emotional resonance.  
2. **Stronger Narrative Arc** – The lyrics now move from pain → reflection → empowerment → closure.  
3. **Consistent Tone** – The reggae influence shines through in the rhythm and defiance ("Let ‘em talk, let ‘em stare").  
4. **Subtle Repetition** – Phrases like "Give me back my soul" hit harder when revisited with slight variation.  

Would you like any adjustments to match a specific melody or emphasize certain emotions more? This version keeps your original intent while polishing the delivery.



## Message

*"Love has no frontier, love is love."*


The song 'No one' talk about the loss of a loved one. Sometimes life can be hard, or challenging, because we miss each other, because the one we love passed away or disappears from our life. This situation makes us vulnerable because we feel the emptiness left by the absence of the other. Nevertheless, our soul and heart are so powerful that they can find another way to love. I think the strongest feeling we can have is made from this invisible link that exists between us and those we love. In his song, 'One more light', Linkin Park says: "Just coz you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there"
The song "Girl" is about a romantic break up between 2 girls. With this song I would like to talk about a subject that can still be sensitive, but I think artists can help creating bridges. I hope that with this song, I can touch the heart of anyone. Love has no frontier, love is love.
